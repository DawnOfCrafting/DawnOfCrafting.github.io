	<description>	
        2 brothers making a unique iOS game focused on crafting mechanics.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        They were frustrated by all game companies who didn't care much about the crafting mechanics, so they decided to craft a game that did.
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        They are known to care for their players, their actions, inputs, thoughts and ideas. They develop games with the input of the community. This gives an edge over most other games.

            TODO: Our general history?

			<header>Early history</header>
            <text>Demi and Goku started working together early in their lives creating mischief as toddlers. They started founding guilds/clans/alliances in competitive games since the age of 8 and 10. Goku became a pro LoL player while at college. At 2012 they started building web and mobile apps.
            </text>

		<history>
            <header>A Prototype: Crafter Game</header>
            <text>They started a small project called Crafter Game at December 2015, which got love pretty fast so they kept working on it. They built a community and changed its name to Dawn of Crafting. Since building such a game would require a lot of development time, they moved back to Turkey from San Francisco where it was economically wiser to develop a game.
            </text>

				<history>
			<header>Betting Their Life on Dawn of Crafting</header>
            <text>They've been working on Dawn of Crafting for over a year now and their time is almost up. Because military service is mandatory in Turkey. If Dawn of Crafting doesnâ€™t become a success until September 2017 they wonâ€™t have enough money to buy out or escape the country and Demi will have to do military service. Maybe youâ€™ve seen what ISIS does to captured Turkish soldiers. Will they be able to make enough money to escape the military service? or will Demi become a soldier in the Turkish military and risk getting beheaded or burned alive?

                Run into an issue? Send 'em a message in game! They respond fairly quickly and *gasp!* actually listen! Phenomenal work guys. I look forward to supporting this game for quite some time.

            <description>I was drawn into this game in the early stages. The devs seem to be working hard to continue to support it. (Thanks guys! I look forward to the updates every week.)
                I'm hoping that your imagination never runs out. I would love to see it continue on from using stone to metal. Moving on to potential blacksmithing. Perhaps even getting into some real complex items. This is truly a game where the journey is more fun then the destination. Thank you and keep it up!

            <description>Over 50 hours sunk into this game. You won't regret getting this game. You have to use use logic to figure out crafting recipes. Balance the need to eat with the need to craft items. Devs are active on Reddit and constantly update the game based on our ideas. Just get it

                                <p>TL;DR: Craft inventions and Discover recipes.
        <br><br>
        Dawn of Crafting is a unique iOS game about crafting in the Stone Age.
        <br><br>
        You are lost young Homo Sapien whos village was destroyed by the Homo Erectus. Another Sapien, Alf who happens to be a Master Crafter, one of the best crafters of the age, takes you as his apprentice and teaches you the fine points of crafting. You learn everything you can, increase your skills, disfcover new recipes and craft a shit ton of stuff. You start building a new village with Alf. Every now and then other people, like merchants, gamblers, Neanderthals, Erectus, thieves, storytellers, visit your village. Sometimes they talk and leave, sometimes they stay. But your time will eventually end. A new young crafter will start learning the fine arts of crafting and further progress humankind.
        <br><br>
        You look out over your village and it’s inhabitants. Then remember how you started out with nothing but sticks, stones and a determination to survive. You remember with fondness how you built your first tools under the tutelage of Alf. You remember exploring and making discoveries, passing one technological achievement after another while slowly taking control of the environment. Now look how far you’ve come. But you can’t stop here. You must keep on honing your skills. You must keep inventing new ways to progress. Who knows what technologies the Neanderthals have? Yes, you can feel the inspiration and an idea slowly coming to life. There is something you have to build. You start walking toward your minion's hut to give him one more mission.
        <br><br>
        Gather food, cook it, eat it, make an axe, chop down a tree, craft tools, craft containers, try to discover another recipe, need a better tool it, gather more wood, peel the wood, get some vine, sharpen some stones, try to craft a knife, tak to a Neanderthal, feel lost, think of what you were going to do, oh right discover that darn recipe!
        <br><br>
        Dawn of Crafting is inspired from the games Minecraft, Ultima Online, A Dark Room, Little Alchemy.
        <br><br>

        <p>The prototype for Mini Metro, Mind the Gap, was created at the end of April 2013 during the three-day Ludum Dare 26 Jam. The first pre-alpha build was made public in September 2013. Mini Metro was put up on Steam Greenlight in March 2014 and was greenlit within three weeks. Mini Metro was released on Early Access on the 11th of August, 2014. After more than a year of additional develoment, the game launched out of Early Access on 9th of November, 2015. The iOS and Android versions launched on the 18th of October, 2016.

<br>
Who am I?<br><br>
It took me years to consider that I should have studied design; being labeled “the computer kid” makes applying to study computer science at an engineering school a certain kind of inevitable choice. At Cal Poly San Luis Obispo I learned how to be a strong software engineer while finding ways to satisfy a growing desire to design. This lead to internships at Apple and Airbnb doing front-end web-app work, which led to realizing that I didn’t really want to do front-end web-app work. I did really want to develop iOS apps so I began building Blackbox, learning along the way.

So you made a video game?<br><br>

The first time I actually grasped the phrase “outside-the-box” was when I had been presented 6 toothpicks and asked to create 4 equally-sized triangles anyway I could, without breaking any toothpicks. (Anyone that’s attempted this is probably familiar with the stages of “This is impossible.”, “Are you sure I can’t break them?”, and “What if I only break one of them?”) Once I stubbornly committed to the idea that this was clearly impossible, my friend placed 3 toothpicks to form a triangle before he reached for a 4th… He held it in the air at a curious diagonal while reaching with his other hand for a 5th. The 6th toothpick completed the prism and in a moment of frisson I saw how boxed in my thinking had become.<br><br>
Skills based in linear thinking, like engineering and math, A-to-B skills, are relatively straight-forward to hone and sharpen. But skills based in creative, circuitous, outside-the-box thinking are far more nebulous and hard to readily improve. There are rote methods that can help, like thinking from first-principles, but generally outside-the-box thinking skills are only expanded with practice.<br><br>
With practiced creative thinking, breakthroughs form more easily around the smallest grains of inspiration, however and whenever they decide to strike. It’s my hope that Blackbox can be both a conduit for strengthening outside-the-box, creative muscle and just a fun game.

<br>
Octodad started as a student project under the team name DGE2 (DePaul Game Experience 2) at DePaul University and was created by a team of 18 people within a time-span of 4 months. Our goal with the project was to produce a game from idea to release to be ready for the Independent Games Festival student competition. We entered the competition on November 1st, the same day that the game was released to the wild. We found ourselves pretty overwhelmed by the press attention that followed and on January 10th, 2011 we found out that we had actually been chosen as an IGF Student Showcase Winner! This means that out of 283 games we placed in the top 8 for the student section. We took the game on the road to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, CA and even managed to scrounge up a nice Microsoft Kinect demo for people to try out on the show floor.

Why Crashlands Matters
<br><br>
This game was developed by a team of 3 brothers, Adam, Seth, and Sam Coster, after Sam was diagnosed with stage 4b Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system) in late 2013. It's been the thing that kept Sam truly living during the cancer treatments, even when he relapsed in late early 2015 and had to go through two stem-cell transplants to kill the damn thing.
<br><br>
The game blends crafting and adventure with a frictionless sense of exploration, all achieved by removing the concept of INVENTORY and INVENTORY MANAGEMENT from the game. The inventory of Crashlands is infinite and self-managing, meaning players spend the vast majority of their time interacting with the world and not moving things around in menus.
<br><br>
Then there's the epic story about the galactic trucker who just wants to deliver her damn packages, but has her wants thwarted by a megalomaniacal alien, Hewgodooko, and ends up getting entangled in a world's worth of problems. There are multiple alien races on display and 50,000+ words worth of story (that's a small book).
<br><br>
And, lastly there's the Crossplatforminess. We wanted Crashlands to be available on everything - so you can get it on Steam and your iPhone and then sync your save between the devices. And the game isn't any different between the two, aside from how much of the world you can see. It controls beautifully regardless of platform and can be taken anywhere.
<br><br>
Get in touch with us by reaching out to Sam@butterscotch-shenanigans.com. We're trying to make the launch of Crashlands the defining indie moment of early 2016, and we need all the extra power you can bring.
<br><br>
Thank you,<br>
Adam, Seth, Sam<br>
The Butterscotch Brothers<br></p>

    <h2 id="about">About Demi and Goku</h2>
        <p><strong></strong><br/>
        2 brothers making a unique iOS game focused on crafting mechanics.
        <br><br>
        They were frustrated by all game companies who didn't care much about the crafting mechanics, so they decided to craft a game that did.
        <br><br>
        They are known to care for their players, their actions, inputs, thoughts and ideas. They develop games with the input of the community. This gives an edge over most other games.
        </p>

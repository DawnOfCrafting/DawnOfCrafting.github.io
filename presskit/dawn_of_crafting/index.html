                                <p>TL;DR: Craft inventions and Discover recipes.
        <br><br>
        Dawn of Crafting is a unique iOS game about crafting in the Stone Age.
        <br><br>
        You are lost young Homo Sapien whos village was destroyed by the Homo Erectus. Another Sapien Alf, who happens to be a Master Crafter, one of the best crafters of the age, takes you as his apprentice and teaches you the fine points of crafting. You learn everything you can, increase your skills, discover new recipes and craft a shit ton of stuff. You start building a new village with Alf. Every now and then other people, like merchants, gamblers, Neanderthals, Erectus, thieves, storytellers, visit your village. Sometimes they talk and leave, sometimes they stay. But your time will eventually end. A new young crafter will start learning the fine arts of crafting and further progress humankind.
        <br><br>
        You look out over your village and it’s inhabitants. Then remember how you started out with nothing but sticks, stones and a determination to survive. You remember with fondness how you built your first tools under the tutelage of Alf. You remember exploring and making discoveries, passing one technological achievement after another while slowly taking control of the environment. Now look how far you’ve come. But you can’t stop here. You must keep on honing your skills. You must keep inventing new ways to progress. Who knows what technologies the Neanderthals have? Yes, you can feel the inspiration and an idea slowly coming to life. There is something you have to build. You start walking toward your minion's hut to give him one more mission.
        <br><br>
        Gather food, cook it, eat it, make an axe, chop down a tree, craft tools, craft containers, try to discover another recipe, need a better tool it, gather more wood, peel the wood, get some vine, sharpen some stones, try to craft a knife, tak to a Neanderthal, feel lost, think of what you were going to do, oh right discover that darn recipe!
        <br><br>
        Dawn of Crafting is inspired from the games Minecraft, Ultima Online, A Dark Room, Little Alchemy.

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>

        
            <strong>A Prototype: Crafter Game</strong>
            <p>Prototype for called Crafter Game started at December 2015. After a week of development it was submitted to the App Store and was released at Jan 09, 2016. It was also free with no Ads, no IAPs. It would take a real optimist to call it a game at this point. We knew even we wouldn't play it, so why would someone else?
                <br>
                <br>
                While working on a little more playable version, we were expecting the game to be completely ignored. No downloads, no comments, no emails. Then someone left this review:
                <br>
                <br>
                Good start - 5 Stars<br>
                "Pretty fun actually. Eventually the game crashed and I lost my progress, but it shows potential. I had just unlocked cherries and it wasn't clear if there was much more content. You should check out /r/incremental_games on Reddit this game is kind of like what that community likes."<br>
                by Qazedsaw – Jan 12, 2016
                <br>
                <br>
                We were surprised, someone actually gave a shit and 5 stars to our shitty little concept. We also learned that the player wanted to see more content and we learned about a new community, /r/incremental_games. We found out that this incremental games community is full of early adopters that will try games regardless of their graphics and completeness. This community was a gold mine for us because:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. This was our first game ever! We were good at playing games but didn't know how to make any game, especially a fun game.<br>
                2. We lacked patience. We are not the types of people who can stick to a game in stealth mode for 2 years and release it, we needed that feedback adrenaline.<br>
                <br>
                So we started to post to /r/incremental_games whenever we made an update to get new players and new feedback. We had to hunt every new player one by one, let them play the game, note their criticsm and fix the stuff they told us.</p>
        
            <strong>More Feedback</strong>
            <p>A while later we got another review:
                <br>
                <br>
                Simple yet Addictive - 4 Stars<br>
                "Normally I do not comment on any app. Yet now, with this nice idea packaged into a simple yet quickly to understand style, I am writing my first review. I can not wait until I get more quests and unlock more recipes. I feel like there is so much more I still need to discover. It would help to get a craft list as well, instead of just the recipes for the food. Since now I have no idea of how to combine my other items. So there is a little point to improve, other than that- I'm addicted as of now."<br>

                <br>
                Wow, this dude who doesn't comment on any apps just left us 4 stars and said he is addicted to our crappy little game? Also gave us the idea to add a Recipe Book, which is basically a built in wiki for all the crafting recipes. He wants more quests, more recipes and recipes other than food. We didn't have anything else at that point. We didn't even had food that makes sense to craft, like peel bananas.</p>
        
            <strong>Crafter Game -----> Dawn of Crafting</strong>
            <p>March 17, 2017<br>
                We made a post a few months ago to get suggestions for a new name. We got a lot of names, then made a poll with them. The name posted by our active player AntiLiterat was instantly liked at the first post and won the poll. So thats where Dawn of Crafting came from.</p>

    <h2 id="about">About Demi and Goku</h2>
        <p><strong></strong><br/>
        2 brothers making a unique iOS game focused on crafting mechanics.
        <br><br>
        They were frustrated by all game companies who didn't care much about the crafting mechanics, so they decided to craft a game that did.
        <br><br>
        They are known to care for their players, their actions, inputs, thoughts and ideas. They develop games with the input of the community. This gives an edge over most other games.
        </p>
